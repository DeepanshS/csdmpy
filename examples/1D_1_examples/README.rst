Scalar, 1D{1} datasets
======================

The 1D{1} datasets are one dimensional, :math:`d=1`, with
one single-component, :math:`p=1`, dependent variable. The 1D{1} datasets are most
the common. In this section, we walk through some examples of 1D{1} datasets from
different spectroscopies.
