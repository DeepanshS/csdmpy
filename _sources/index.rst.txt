==================================
Welcome to csdfpy's documentation!
==================================


The :guilabel:`csdfpy` package is the Python support for the core scientific
dataset (CSD) model. The CSD model is the first step forward towards a portable
scientific dataset format and is capable of handling a wide variety of
scientific datasets both with and across disciplinary fields. The main
objective of this python package is to facilitate an easy import and export
of the CSD model files for Python programmers. Because the :guilabel:`csdfpy`
package utilizes Numpy arrays, it empowers the end users to process or
visualize the datasets with any third party package(s) compatible with Numpy.
