In this section, we show a few examples of the scientific datasets stored
as the CSD model format.
To accentuate the versatile of the model, we have converted a wide variety of
datasets from various scientific fields to the CSD model file-format.
Because the model is both multi-dimensional in the controlled
and uncontrolled variables, we use a shorthand notation
:math:`((p_\alpha,),d)`-D to describe the datasets, where :math:`p_\alpha` is
the number of dimensions of the uncontrolled variable, and
:math:`d` is the number of controlled variables.

The CSD model utilizes the JSON file-serialization for
data-exchange. In the following, we list two types of file extensions
associated with the JSON serialized files, `.csdf` and `.csdfx`, the acronyms
for the Core Scientific Dataset Format and the Core Scientific Dataset Format
eXternal. The two file extensions act as a medium to convey the end users
whether the data values are present within the file (`.csdf`) or in an external
file on a local or remote server (`.csdfx`).

Given our expertise in the NMR spectroscopy, we include more examples from this
field, although, efforts have been made to include examples from
interdisciplinary sciences.
In this regard, one should note that NMR datasets are diverse and
multi-dimensional in nature, and are thus, an excellent test case for our data
model.
