In this section, we present some example datasets stored as the CSD
model format, either with a `.csdf` or `.csdfx` file extension.
To accentuate the versatile of the CSD model, we have converted a variety of
dataset from various scientific fields to the CSD model file-format.
Because the model contains both, multi-dimensional controlled
and multi-dimensional uncontrolled variables, we prefer to use a shorthand
notation :math:`((p_\alpha,),d)`-D dataset, where :math:`p_\alpha` is the
number of dimensions of the uncontrolled variable, and
:math:`d` is the number of controlled variables.

Given our expertise in NMR spectroscopy, we include more examples from this
field, although, efforts have been made to include examples from
interdisciplinary sciences.
In this regard, one should note that NMR datasets are diverse and
multi-dimensional in nature, and are thus, an excellent test case for our
model.
