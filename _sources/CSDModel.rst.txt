The core scientific dataset (CSD) model
=======================================

The core scientific dataset (CSD) model is a *light-weight*, *portable*,
*versatile*, and *standalone* data model capable of handling a variety of
scientific datasets. The model only encapsulates data values and minimum
metadata, to accurately describe the data coordinates and
coordinates metadata. The model is not intended to encapsulate
any information on how the data might be acquired, processed
or visualized. The data model is versatile in allowing many
use cases for any number of experiments from most spectroscopy,
diffraction, and imaging techniques. As such the model
supports datasets associated with continuous physical quantities
that are discretely sampled in a multi-dimensional space
associated with other carefully controlled continuous physical
quantities, for e.g., a mass as a function of temperature, a
current as a function of voltage and time, a signal voltage as
a function of magnetic field gradient strength, etc. It also
supports datasets associated with multi-component data values.
For example, the left and right audio components as a function
of time, a color image with a red, green, and blue (RBG) light
intensity components as a function of two independent spatial
dimensions, and the six components of the symmetric second-rank
diffusion tensor MRI as a function of three independent spatial
dimensions. Additionally, the model supports multiple
datasets when identically sampled over the same set of controlled
variables. For instance, the current and voltage as a function
of time where current and voltage are two datasets sampled over
the same temporal coordinates.

The CSD model is independent of the hardware, operating system,
application software, programming language, and object-oriented
file-serialization format used in writing the CSD model to the
file. Out of numerous file serialization formats, XML, JSON,
property list, we adopt the data-exchange oriented JSON
(JavaScript Object Notation) file-serialization format because
it is easily human readable and also integrable with any
number of programming languages and field related
application-software.

The CSD model follows,

.. math::

    y_\alpha = f_\alpha(x_0, x_1, ... x_k, ... x_{d-1})
    \forall \alpha \in \mathbb{Z}

where :math:`y_\alpha` is the uncontrolled variable and the :math:`x_k`,
:math:`k \in \{0, 1, ... ,d-1\}`, are the controlled variables. The model
supports any arbitrary :math:`d`-dimensional controlled variable space
where :math:`x_k` is its :math:`k^\mathrm{th}` dimension, and any arbitrary
:math:`p_\alpha`-dimensional uncontrolled variable space where every dimension
is a component of the uncontrolled variable.
