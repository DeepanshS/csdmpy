Controlled variables
====================

Based on the type of samplings and the types of coordinates, 
there are three types of controlled variable coordinates.

    * Linearly sampled quantitative grid dimension
    * Arbitrarily sampled quantitative grid dimension
    * Non-quantitative dimensions




Linearly sampled grid dimension
-------------------------------


For example, 

    >>> from MRData import csdfpy
    >>> filename = csdfpy.test_file['test01']
    >>> testdata1 = csdfpy.open(filename)

    creates ``testdata1`` as an instance of the ``CSDModel`` object.
    The instance of the ``_linearlySampledGrid`` class is accessed, 

    >>> x = testdata1.controlled_variables
    >>> print(x)
    (<MRData.csdfpy.controlled_variables._linearlySampledGrid object at 0xa0bc86150>,)


    >>> print ('number of points = ', x[0].number_of_points)
    
This can also be used to assign/update the sampling
interval of the dimension.

    >>> x[0].number_of_points = 5
    >>> print ('new number of points = ', x[0].number_of_points)
    >>> print ('new coordinates = ', x[0].coordinates)
