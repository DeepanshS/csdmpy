The `csdfpy` module
===================

The `csdfpy` module is a Python support for the core scientific
dataset (CSD) model file-format exchange.
This module is based on the core scientific dataset (CSD) model which is
designed as a building block in the development of a more sophisticated
portable scientific dataset file standard.
The CSD model is capable of handling a wide variety of
scientific datasets both within and across disciplinary fields, and therefore
is a serves as viable data-exchange model.

The main objective of this python module is to facilitate an easy import and
export of the CSD model serialized JSON files for Python users. Moreover, the
module utilizes standard Python libraries such as Numpy and Scipy and
therefore empowers the end users to process or visualize the imported datasets
with any third party package(s) compatible with Numpy and Scipy.

=======================================
The core scientific dataset (CSD) model
=======================================

The core scientific dataset (CSD) model is a *light-weight*, *portable*,
*versatile*, and *standalone* data model capable of handling a variety of
scientific datasets.

The model is *light-weight* because it only encapsulates
data values and the minimum metadata, to accurately represent a `p`-component
dependent variable, :math:`y`, discretely sampled at `N` unique points in a
`d`-dimensional independent variable coordinate space
:math:`(x_0, x_1, ... x_k, ... x_{d-1})`.
The model is not intended to encapsulate
any information on how the data might be acquired, processed or visualized.

The data model is *versatile* in allowing many use cases for any number of
experiments from most spectroscopy, diffraction, and imaging techniques. As
such the model supports datasets associated with continuous physical quantities
that are discretely sampled in a multi-dimensional space associated with other
carefully controlled continuous physical quantities, for e.g., a mass as a
function of temperature, a current as a function of voltage and time, a signal
voltage as a function of magnetic field gradient strength, etc. The CSD model
also supports datasets associated with multi-component data values. For
example, a color image with a red, green, and blue (RBG) light intensity
components as a
function of two independent spatial dimensions, or the six components of the
symmetric second-rank diffusion tensor MRI as a function of three independent
spatial dimensions. Additionally, the model supports multiple datasets when
simultaneously sampled over the same set of dependent variables. For instance,
the simultaneous measurement of the current and voltage as a function of time.
Another example would be the simultaneous acquisition of air temperature,
pressure, wind velocity, and
solar-flux as a function of Earthâ€™s latitude and longitude coordinates. We
refer to these simultaneous datasets as `correlated-datasets`.

The CSD model is *standalone* because it is independent of the hardware,
operating system, application software, programming language, and the
object-oriented file-serialization format utilized in writing the CSD model to
the file. Out of numerous file serialization formats, XML, JSON, property list,
we adopt the data-exchange oriented JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) file-
serialization format because it is `human readable`, if properly organized, and
`easily integrable` with any number of programming languages and field related
application-software.

The serialization file names are designated with two possible extensions: .csdf
and .csdfe, the acronyms for Core Scientific Dataset Format and Core Scientific
Dataset Format External. When all data values are stored within the file, then
the .csdf file extension is used, otherwise, the file is serialized with a
.csdfe extension. This difference in extensions is intended to alert the
end user to a possible risk of failure if the external data file is
inaccessible when deserializing a file with the .csdfe file extensions.
