version0.0.10

- Added the reciprocal attribute to the IndependentVariable class.
- Removed the reverse key.
- Changed 'sampling_interval' key to 'increment'.
- Changed 'linearly_sampled' key to 'linear_spacing'.
- Changed 'arbitrarily_sampled' key to 'arbitrary_spacing'.
- Removed fft_output_order key. Reasons unkown.
- Changed the equation defining the coordinates from 
        $X^(ref) = m_k J_k - c_k$
  to
        $X^(ref) = m_k J_k + c_k$,
  where $c_k$ is the reference offset, $m_k$ is the increment, and $J_k$ is the
  set of interger indicies along the dimensoin.
- Added 'description' key to 'IndependentVariable', 'DependentVariable' and 'CSDM' object.

New methods

- sum(index=0) Sum of data values from the dependent variable along the
        independent variable at indicies given by `index`.
- prop(index=0) Product of data values from the dependent variable along the
        independent variable at indicies given by `index`.
