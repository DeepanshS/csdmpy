In this section, we will present some example datasets stored using the CSD
model, either as `.csdf` or `.csdfx` file extension. We take examples
from a variety of scientific fields and in turn demonstrate the versatility of
the CSD model. Because the model contains both, multi-dimensional controlled
and multi-dimensional uncontrolled variables, we prefer to use a shorthand
notation :math:`((p_\alpha,),d)`-D dataset, where :math:`p_\alpha` is the
number of dimensions of the uncontrolled variable, :math:`y_\alpha`, and
:math:`d` is the number of controlled variables.

Given our expertise in NMR spectroscopy, we include more examples from this
field, although, efforts have been made to include examples from
interdisciplinary sciences.
