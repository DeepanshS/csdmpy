It is perhaps best to illustrate the features and functionality of the
`csdfpy` package using examples.
To accentuate the versatile of the model, we have converted a wide variety of
datasets from various scientific fields to the CSD model file-format.
Because the model is both multi-dimensional in the controlled
and uncontrolled variables, we use a shorthand notation
(:math:`(p_\alpha,),d`)-D to describe the datasets, where :math:`p_\alpha` is
the number of dimensions of the uncontrolled variable, and
:math:`d` is the number of controlled variables.

Given our expertise in the NMR spectroscopy, we include more examples from this
field, although, efforts have been made to include examples from
interdisciplinary sciences.
In this regard, one should note that NMR datasets are diverse and
multi-dimensional in nature, and are thus, an excellent probe of the CSD
model.
