In this section, we present illustrative examples, as listed
below, for importing the CSD model serialized data files.
Because CSD model allows multi-dimension datasets, we use a shorthand notation
of :math:`d\mathrm{D}\{p\}` to indicate that
a dataset has a :math:`p`-component dependent variable defined on a
:math:`d`-dimensional independent variable space.
In the case of correlated datasets, the number of components in each dataset
is given as a list within the curly braces, `i.e.`,
:math:`d\mathrm{D}\{p_0, p_1, p_2, ...\}`.

**Example Dataset**

.. toctree::

    1D{1} datasets
    2D{1} datasets/2D{1} datasets
    2D{2} datasets
    2D{3} datasets
